# How to Submit a New Resource Module

1. Ensure your new resource module is in its own public repository.
1. Ensure your new repository is under the MIT license.
1. Ensure your new resource module follows the [High Quality DSC Resource Module Guidelines](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResources/blob/master/HighQualityModuleGuidelines.md).
1. Create a new empty branch in your new resource module repository.
1. Create a pull request between your working branch and the empty branch.
This will allow the reviewers to make comments and see the changes you make based on those comments.
1. Submit an issue in the [main DSC Resource Kit repository](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResources) with a link to the pull request in your repository.
1. Once **at least three** members of the [Dsc Resource Kit Design Review Team](#dsc-resource-kit-design-review-team) have reviewed and approved the new resource module, close the pull request, making sure all changes from the review are in your working branch.
1. Transfer ownership of the new resource module to the PowerShell organization.
