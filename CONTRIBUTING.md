## Branches structure

We are using [git flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) model for development.
We recommend that you create local working branches that target a specific scope of change. 
Each branch should be limited to a single feature/bugfix both to streamline work flow and reduce the possibility of merge conflicts.
