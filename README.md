# DSC Resources

## Repository structure
This is the central repository for PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC) resources.
DSC resources are packaged in PowerShell modules, along with tests, documentation, and examples, each in their own GitHub repositories. 
These repositories are included as [submodules](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule) of the [DscResources](https://github.com/powershell/DscResources) repository you're currently browsing. 

You can clone this repository to download the source for all DSC resource modules 

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResources.git
```

Or just download the respository's structure and documentation
```
git clone https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResources.git
```
